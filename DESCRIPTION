Description: An implementation of the RuleFit algorithm as described in
    Friedman & Popescu (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>. eXtreme Gradient
    Boosting ('XGBoost') is used to build rules, and 'glmnet' is used to
    fit a sparse linear model on the raw and rule features. The result is
    a model that learns similarly to a tree ensemble, while often offering
    improved interpretability and achieving improved scoring runtime in
    live applications. Several algorithms for reducing rule complexity are
    provided, most notably hyperrectangle de-overlapping. All algorithms
    scale to several million rows and support sparse representations to
    handle tens of thousands of dimensions.
